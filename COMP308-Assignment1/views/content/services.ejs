        <p>My experience is primarily in Object Oriented Programming using C#, Java, JavaScript and Python, both on the front end and back end. These are the languages I am most experienced with, however, I do have some experience as well developing apps
        for Android devices as well as front end website/web app development. See my <a href="/projects">projects page</a> for information on what I have previously done.</p>
        <p>If you require any software development services (or are in the Ottawa region and hiring), feel free to <a href="/contact">send me a message</a>. 
        I'll get back to you as soon as possible.</p>
